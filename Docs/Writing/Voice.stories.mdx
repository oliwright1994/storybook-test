# Voice and tone

**Voice** is who we are.

**Tone** is how we respond to different situations.

The appropriate voice builds trust, humanises Smart, and helps engage our audience.

Our **tone** may vary depending on who we're writing for, but our **voice** will always be three things:

- trustworthy
- friendly
- clear

We create useful, concise content for our audience. We don’t want to confuse anyone by being over-complicated, over-formal or over-academic.

Creating well written, easy to understand and consistent content improves the user experience and makes people more likely to trust us. So we should weave our tone of voice through everything we write – from website copy and member benefit statements to forms and terms and conditions.

Our tone of voice shouldn't just be used in marketing content – although that is probably where it will be at its strongest. It should be a point of reference for everyone who has to write on our behalf, for an external or internal audience.



## Voice guidelines


Here’s how we make our writing **trustworthy, friendly** and **clear:**

Trustworthy and authoritative, not arrogant
It’s important to be trustworthy so our customers recognise our authority, and trust us with their personal finances or complex systems.

### We can show we're trustworthy by:

- making sure we always give the reader accurate information
- backing up any claims or quoting sources
- giving facts and statistics to demonstrate our experience and reliability –  but only where they won't confuse the reader, and not talking down to them

### Friendly, not unprofessional
It's important to be friendly to complement that trust, and so that people know we are helpful and approachable.

We make our writing friendly by:

- talking in the same way you would a good friend, showing respect and communicating with them on their level
- being informal by doing things like using contractions and sticking to every day language, where appropriate
- using "us" and "we" to refer to Smart, and "you" to refer to the reader
Clear, not condescending
It’s important to be clear so we’re easily understood, no matter who we're talking to.

### Our writing is clear because:

- we don't assume knowledge
- we avoid jargon wherever possible – and explain it when we can't
- we use short sentences and short paragraphs
- we use [the active voice](https://www.example.com)
