# How we write for Smart

At Smart, we have different audiences depending on what channel we're using, and what product or service we're talking about.

Most of the time we're talking to people directly about their personal finances and their pension savings. We sell and explain sophisticated products to our clients and customers. We need to make sure they understand us and trust us – or where to go if they need help.

These principles should apply to everything we write, and they form the backbone of our [tone of voice](https://www.example.com).

## We know our audience
It's easier to write well if you understand who you're writing for.

By knowing what your audience is interested in or worried about, your content will:

- be relevant

- catch their attention

- answer their questions

It's important to know how your audience talks. This will help you use the same terms and phrases as them when talking about an issue or topic. Your content will then be easier to understand and find.

## We put the user first
Don't publish everything you can. Only tell someone what they need to know so they can complete their task. Nothing more.

People don't usually read text unless they want information or instructions. When you write, the first question you should ask is "what does the user want to know?".

Meeting a user need means being:

- specific

- informative

- clear and to the point

## We're compliant
As a leading fintech operating our own master trust, we need to make sure all our content is compliant.

Some of the things we write will have to go through specific compliance and legal sign off to meet regulation. But even if it doesn't, our content should always stick to these guidelines to make sure it's compliant.

- Don't make any wild, misleading, or untrue claims. For example, "Our pension scheme means you'll be rich in retirement"
- Give guidance, never advice. Refer people to [The Pensions Advisory Service, Pension Wise](https://www.example.com) and other services if they need advice
- Always use the right names for things such as products, services and legislation. For example, it's **Smart Pension Master Trust** not **The Smart Pension scheme**
- Make it clear who or where communications are coming from. This will usually be us, but it could also be one of our partners, a director or trustee, or another third party


## We make our content easy to read
Our content should provide clear, easy to understand information to our users. Complicated writing and large blocks of text get in the way of this information.

Easy to read content uses:

- short sentences

- sub-headed sections

- bulleted lists (like this one)

## We use plain English
The average reading age in the UK is about 9 years old. Even if our audience contains those with a higher reading age, we should use words that are easy to understand wherever possible.

Try to avoid jargon or difficult terms. If you have to use them, make sure you explain them.

Plain English doesn't mean "dumbing down" your writing or only using short words. It's about getting your message across efficiently and in a friendly manner.

Using plain English is as simple as writing in the way most of us speak.

- Write in the active voice wherever appropriate (see below)

- Use 'you' and 'we'

- Use everyday words you know the reader will understand

- Use contractions when it feels natural to do so
- Avoid turning a process into a noun – this is known as "nominalization". For example, "upon arrival" should be "when you arrive"

If you find yourself about to write, type or dictate a word you wouldn’t use in every day conversation, [look it up in the A to Z of words to avoid](https://www.example.com). You should find a simpler alternative. Often there will be a choice of several words. You need to pick the one that best fits what you are trying to say.



## Using the active voice
When writing for Smart, we use the active voice and avoid the passive voice.

**Active voice:**

- "we've set up your workplace pension"

**Passive voice:**

- "your workplace pension has been set up"

We avoid the passive voice because it's often wordier, difficult to read, and overly formal – meaning it can alienate readers.

It can be difficult to spot the passive voice. A good rule of thumb is that if your clause could end with "...by monkeys." and still make sense, you're probably using the passive voice. For example:

- "50% of your to-do list **has been completed**" (...by monkeys)
- "contributions of £123 **were made** ~~by your employer~~" (...by monkeys)
- "a pension transfer **was initiated** (...by monkeys) last month"

There are some exceptions to avoiding the passive voice. For example, if you're talking about an action that will be taken by someone other than Smart, the user, or someone known to them:

- "your funds will be invested"

You may also choose to use the passive voice in error messages or in negative communications, to avoid placing blame on the user:

- "your password was entered incorrectly"
- "your scheme will be cancelled unless you..."
