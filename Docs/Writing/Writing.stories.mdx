# Write Smart - The content style guide


**The way we talk is just as important as how we look.**

Financial services and pension providers often use confusing terms, complex jargon and bureaucratic language. We can change that.

This guide is for everyone who writes for and on behalf of Smart, for any audience. If we all stick to these rules, our writing will be consistent and easy to understand.

There may be slight variations in the tone you use depending on who you're writing for. You can read more about this on the voice and tone page.
